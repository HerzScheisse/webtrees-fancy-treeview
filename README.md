Introduction
-----------
This module is a rewritten version of the Fancy treeview module for webtrees 1.

This module adds an additional 'Descendants and ancestors' tab to the individual page.

This tab shows the details of the current individual and his descendants in the next two generations in a narrative way. With one click, you switch to the current individual and his ancestors in the next two generations.

If more generations are available, they can be accessed by clicking on the readmore link, which redirects to a separate page that displays all generations from the current individual to the last accessible generation (up or down) in a narrative way.

This way you give your users a quick overview of the family tree of the chosen individual. Of course, privacy rules are respected.

Currently there is no configuration page and it is not possible to reach the Fancy Treeview page from the menu or download the Fancy Treeview page as a pdf as in the webtrees 1 version. Future versions may re-implement these features.

Translations
------------
You can help to translate this module. The language files will become available at [POEditor][3] where you can update them. But you can also use a local editor, like poeditor or notepad++ to make the translations and send them back to me. You can do this via a pull request (if you know how) or by e-mail. Updated translations will be included in the next release of this module.

Installation & upgrading
------------------------
Unpack the zip file and place the folder jc-fancy-treeview in the modules_v4 folder of webtrees. Upload the newly added folder to your server. It is activated by default. Go to the control panel to set some options.
